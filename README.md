Basically just a portfolio site to show some things I've done, but also a place to mess around with new frontend technologies on a whim.

# Dev scripts

 - `npm start` serves files, and re-compile file that changed
 - `npm run lint-fix` applies linting
 - `npm run build` builds minified version ready for deployment
 - TODO: script to run aws cli and deploy files to s3 bucket

# Major remaining tasks

 - css beautification??
 - update PDF resume
 - proofread
 - https
 -------- initial deployment ----------
 - updated picture on landing page
 - unit tests not working
   - maybe just delete until there is some behavior worth testing
 - archived could probably be replaced by some pre-rendered version of each route
    - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snapshot
 - remove this section
